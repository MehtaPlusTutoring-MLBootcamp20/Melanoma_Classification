          <h1>Abstract</h1>
          <p>The most common cancer globally is skin cancer. Early detection of skin cancer can drastically increase patient survival rates; therefore, a computerized image classification system of skin lesions can save time and by extension human life. In this paper, we elevate a traditional unimodal model which inputs only images into a CNN into a state-of-the-art multimodal model which concatenates the CNN image model with metadata features. Our results show that our multimodal model outperforms the unimodal model by a 9.5% increase in accuracy. We further improve our model by exploring various CNN architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and VGG16. Our accuracies increased by 7.22% when using ResNet-18, and we confirm these results by applying the Grad-CAM algorithm on our skin lesion images.</p>
